## Preface

Data is the lifeblood of many modern organisations.
Managing it properly is key for delivering routine services efficiently and in guiding management decision
making.
For research organisations like Burnet, data is an extremely valuable commodity as it is the substrate from
which discoveries are made, innovations are conceived and policy/public health decisions are justified.
To have maximum impact, data we collect as researchers should be available for reuse if it is in the best
interests of the public, while taking the neccessary precautions to prevent sensitive, private or personal
data from being disseminated innapropriately.

Burnet collects and manages a great variety of data types, from laboratory results, to survey data, to
clinical records, qualitative data, population wide data and datasets originating from other sources such as
governments, other NGOs, companies and public domain.
These data sets vary in sizes, file types, purpose and sensitivity, and so there won't be a one-size-fits-all
solution to data management at Burnet.
Rather, there will likely be a heirarchical approach with a few core tenets for research data as a whole and
then more specific directives at the discipline level and specific plans at the sub-discipline level.
In this draft plan we are laying out a set of guidelines and standard operating procedures for the management
of bioinformatics data.

Bioinformatics, generally speaking is the application of computer technology to enable discoveries in biology
and medicine.
Data sets can be both extremely large (100GB to 10TB per project), involve complex experimental designs,
be collected over long periods of time (some projects take 10 years from conception to publication).
While the number of participants is relatively small as compared to public health focused research, the
trend towards larger cohort studies is increasing, which will place significant strain upon data managers in
bioinformatics.
Best practices in this area could improve efficiency as well as lower the risk of data loss or inappropriate
dissemination.


## Goals of data management

1. Compliance. Fundamentally, data management practices are motivated by the need to remain compliant with
the mandates of Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research

2. Protect the privacy and personal information of participants.

3. Retain research data safely during the project and after if appropriate.

4. Report and disseminate data responsibly.

## Responsibilities

Institutions must:

> Provide access to facilities for the safe and secure storage and management of research data,
> records and primary materials and, where possible and appropriate, allow access and reference.

> Have a policy that covers the secure and safe retention of materials and research data.

> In general, the minimum recommended period for retention of research data is
> 5 years from the date of publication.

> Have a policy that covers the secure and safe disposal of research data when the retention period is over.

and primary materials when the specified period of retention has finished
Researchers must:

> Retain clear, accurate, secure and complete records of all research including research data and
> primary materials. Where possible and appropriate, allow access and reference to these by
> interested parties.

## Research life cycle in bioinformatics

A typical project may involve:

* Ideation.

* Involvement of several collaborating parties and their groups for example scientists, clinicians,
administrators, epidemiologists, public health experts and technicians, from different sectors including
academic, NGO, public and private industry.
These individuals may be in senior or junior positions, and may have some knowledge of bioinformatics or
data management practices or none at all. Local or international.

* Project planning, which may involve a application for funding, budgeting, experimental design,
preliminary data generation and analysis.

* Main project data collection phase.

* Main project data analysis phase (may occur in parallel with data collection).
Analysis is typically intertwined with dissemination in mind, for example a manuscript might be prepared
at the same time as data analysis if publication is the objective.
Or if the objective is commercialisation, a patent application may be written in parallel with data analysis.

* Dissemination. The journal article is accepted/published. The de-identified research data can be shared.

* Maintenance. After a project is completed, reported and key data is shared researchers may still need to
attend to any issues that arise after publication, for example members of the scientific community identify
missing data, or problems with the data and findings which need to be addressed.
