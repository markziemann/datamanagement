In the scoping phase we need to:

## Define what it is we want to do.

* We want to preserve research data so it can be reused and disseminated in future.

* We want to maintain our research data and files so it can be findable and non-redundant.

* We want to protect any personal data from dissemination to the wrong people.

## How are organisations are doing things

## What is the literature is telling us about data management
